#two-sample 't'-test
#it's used to determine whether an Unknown Popullation MEAN of TWO groups are equal

#case study: 63 subject were given a drug (treatment group and an additional 6 subject a placebo ( control group).Their reaction time to a stimulus was measured (in ms), we want to perform a TWO-sample test for comparing the means of the treatment and control groups.
# 1st sample; 91,87,99,77,88,91  ( reaction time observation during making of medicines)
# 2nd sample; 101,110,103,93,99,104 ( reaction time observation during actual trial of medicines)

# Here we have to check whether both samples have same MEAN or not?
